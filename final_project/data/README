**This script include ‘eval = FALSE’ for some sections, mostly the NLP transformation and model fitting, to save the run time across re-knit. The NLP transformation results are in included in this data folder, but the model fitting results are not, due to their sizes. If you see a line of code that load from './data/models/', then the code will not run. Instead, please change the eval of the previous R section into TRUE to run and save the corresponding model locally.**
